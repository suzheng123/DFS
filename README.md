algorithm problems

minimum SubTree: 
Input: {1,-5,2,1,2,-4,-5}
Output:1
Explanation:
The tree is look like this:

                                 1
                               /   \
                             -5     2
                             / \   /  \                           
                            0   2 -4  -5
                            
The sum of whole tree is minimum, so return the root: 1. 


closest bst: 
  example 1: 
    Input: root = {5,4,9,2,#,8,10} and target = 6.124780
    Output: 5
  example 2: 
    Input: root = {3,2,4,1} and target = 4.142857
    Output: 4
